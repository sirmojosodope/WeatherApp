This is my Weather application.

This application has Html, Css, and javascript. I wanted to incorporate moment.js but I have yet to do so as of now. This assignment was hard because this was my first time working with moment.js as well as implementing an application. In the future I will be updating this to include moment.js another hard part of this was having a save history function when I type in a city name so the user wouldn't have to type in the city name again. 

Overall could've done this better.
